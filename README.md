<h3>University Admit Eligibility Predictor</h3>

<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>  
 
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Today all the work at the time of admission of the students is done manually by ink and paper, which is very slow and consuming much efforts and time. In the modern world of technology, computer is affecting our lives in more ways than we probably are aware of computerized management maintaining information of an educational institute, colleges, other the list is endless. The main principle behind the need of college admission system is easy supervision of institutes. It can handle the details of students such as marks details. This Student Database has been designed taking into account the practical needs to manage a student’s data. Moreover, it provides security at product level as well as user level.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When students come from rural places, they find it hard to go along with the formal procedures. So, this application helps them a lot and eases out their fear. Whatever may be their scores, this application helps to find the best colleges. Hence, our proposed computer aided system will help the students to get the list of all colleges in which they could get the admission at the click of a button. The students only have to enter their marks of XII, AIEEE etc. With this application, the students can very easily obtain the list of colleges even branch wise and course wise. This will not only make the admission process easy but also minimizes stress for students. The main objective of our system is to make the right choice of colleges.</p>  

<h4>MOTIVATION</h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The motivation of this project is to help the students to save their time and money that they have to spend at the education consultancy firms. And also it will help them to limit their number of application to a small number by proving them the suggestion of the universities where they have the best chance of securing admission thus saving more money on the application fees. Choosing the right universities or colleges is definitely an hurdle students have to face. Many students apply for the universities in which they have little chance of acceptance. This leads students of poor economic backgrounds to frustration and anxiety as they only lose surplus amount of money just for applying to those universities.This system that could guide students and recommend best universities list and predict their admission chance in those universities according to their profile and scores.</p>

The main advantage of the project is the computerization of the entrance seat allotment process. Administrator has the power for the allotment. He can add the allotted seats into a file and the details are saved into the system. The total time for the entrance allotment became lesser and the allotment process became faster.
